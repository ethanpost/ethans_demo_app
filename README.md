# Ethan's Oracle APEX Demo App

You can import this app into a workspace. Components in this app have dependencies on my ArcSQL library and possibly other libraries. 

Thanks,

## All In One Login Form With Email Support

This app contains a single login form that handles login, registration, forgot password recovery with email support. Look for the saas_auth code in my list of repos.

### Latest News
* You can now use the REQUEST object when linking to the form to pass in either REGISTER, LOGIN, FORGOT, or CHANGE and the form will automatically load the correct view.

## SAAS Assets

There are two pages realted to saas assets functionality. I don't recommend you use it. I published a basic working version. The design has many ideas I like but the implementation is far too complicated. I am abandoning this for now but may revisit someday. You will need to get the code for saas_assets from another repo.
